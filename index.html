      <div id="tribute-info" class="center"><p>I am one among the million ardent fans of the captain cool who is trying to learn some points of life from him, the proud Indian. Observe him and you will get your personality molded in an awesome manner.

        Not many can climb the ladder easily from examining the passengers’ train tickets to leading the country’s greatest sport. You gain popularity and at the same time, you will be hearing the irritating barks of haters.
        
        I learnt and admire,</p>
        
       <p> His respect towards seniors, when he handed over the captaincy to Sourav in his ultimate test match.</p>
        
   <p>His focus, when he tries to stop the ball behind the stumps when no slips are placed for a spinner.</p>
        
        <p>His spontaneity, when he thrashes the stump biles at lightning speed.</p>
        
       <p>
          His patriotism, when he gave second priority to the little princess Ziva.</p>
        
          <p>  His innovation, when the helicopter flies over the roof of the stadium.</p>
        
          <p> His psychological play, when he places the leg slip at irregular position.</p>
        
          <p> His humbleness, when he hands the winning trophy to the youngsters.</p>
        
          <p> His loyalty, when he talked about CSK and its fans in the Rising Pune Super Giants press meet.</p>
        
          <p>  His leadership quality, when he takes the blame for a losing match.</p>
        
          <p> His calmness, in the pressure situations. (Leading a billion people favourite sport team is itself an immense pressure)
        
      </p>
      <p> His language, when he speaks in the post-match presentations.</p>
        
      <p> His patience, when answering the immature journalists.
      </p>
      <p> His decision making, when he promoted himself watching Sachin’s dismissal in Wankhede-2011.
      </p>

      <p>His Smile which remains a constant irrespective of the match result.</p>
        
      <p> His THUG life, when he dashed Mustafizur Rehman for blocking his run.</p>
        
      <p> His THUG life, when he trolled Pollard in long on taking the quick second run.</p>
        
      <p>His THUG life, when he made the reporter answer his own question about his retirement.</p>
        
      <p> His THUG life…</p>
